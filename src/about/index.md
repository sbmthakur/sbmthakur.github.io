Thanks for stopping by. I am a Grad student in Computer Science and have worked as a Backend engineer. I like building, maintaining, and scaling backend systems that solve crucial problems. This blog will have articles about tools that help me to achieve that. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:sbmthakur@gmail.com">sbmthakur@gmail.com</a> for any suggestions, criticism, or if you want to say Hi!
